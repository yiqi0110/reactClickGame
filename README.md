# React Click Game

### Technologies Used
>   Just React.js.

### Difficulties
- Deployment -
    Given that this was my first deployment of a React app on Github, I was unfamiliar with exactly how to. However, after some simple research it became very clear.
- State - 
    With the shuffle functionality of the images as well as the images holding a clicked state, after a few hours of struggling with some strange logic errors. It became apparent that I would have to use state in order to create the desired results.
